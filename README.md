## Tower Assembly Task
### 1. Navigate to the Tower_Assembly directory and in ```TASC_tower.py```, set weights on value, effort, and legibility (wV, wE, wL)
### 2. Run ```TASC_tower.py``` to get policies for robot and human teammate
### 3. Input polices in ```MTurk_towers_effort.html```
### 4. Run ```MTurk_towers_effort.html``` on Google Chrome
